VPC- it is like lab or office.
subnet-it like room or cabins in office.

ex.in every organiztion more than 1 servers are available. 1 is main server second 1 is for backup both
are kept seperate for the reason of data safety. in this senario we create subnet for both server .. subnet-1. subnet-2 resp.






VPC	- althogh the structure of vpc looks simmilar to a standerd network that you'd operate in a data center, a 
	vpc will have the benefits of the scallable infrastucture of AWS.

	>you create subnet route table, configure network gateway control network access control lists, chose ip address range and many
	more in a virtual  private cloud. 
	>another mojor advantage of vpc is that it is fully customizable.

Internet Gateway - 
		An internet gateway is a logical connection between amazon VPC  & the internet If vpc does not have internet gateway 
		then the resourses in the vpc cannot be accessed from the internet. (unless the traffic flows via a cooperative network and VPN/Direct 			Connect)
		- It means we buying a router.we use the for giving  vpc access to internet

VPC Peering - 
		A VPC  peering connection in a networking connection between two vpc's that enable you to route traffic between then using private IPv4
		address and IPv6 Adressess.

Security Group - 
		In VPC, a security group's function is to manage the traffic for the instances. Instances  can be single in number  of many.
		actually, it doess act as virtual firewall that can control inbound and outbound traffic from differant EC-2 Instances.
		you can manually add rules to the each security group to control traffic within the associate instances.



**VPC LIKE A OFFICE OR LAB - IN EVERY ORG 2 SERVER 1 FOR MAINN OTHER ONE IS FOR BACKUP INN THIS SENARIO WE CREATE  A SUBNET  ..  SUBNET 1 FFOR SERVER 1 SUBNET 2 IS FOR SERVER 2
**SUBNET IS LIKE A ROOMS IN THE LAB
**INTERNET  GATEWAY IS  ROUTER - IT MEANNS BUYING ROUTER AND AND WE USE THIS FOR ESTABLISH CONNESCTIONN BETWEEN 
VPC TO  INTERNET..

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step-1  Create VPC
	> assign name [my vpc]
	> ip address ... 10.0.0.0/16
	In  aws we can assing IP Between in 16 to 28
	>secect class ABC
	>Tenacy[Default,Dedicated]
	create vpc.

Step-2  Create Subnet [we cant create 2 subnet in 1 availability zone]
	assign name 
	seelect avaibility zone -1a
	subnet cidr block ---- 10.0.0.0/28 ...for subnet 2 ... 10.0.1.0/28 ... for subnet 3 ... 10.0.2.0/28
	[if we have multiple subnet or room we cant assign same range ip address for both room or lab]

Step-3 Internet Gateway [Creating Router]
	asssign name 
	create Internet Gateway
	attach to VPC
	select VPC 
	Attach to VPC

Step-3 Route Table 
	select VPC 
	route >> edit route 
		>add route 
	>0.0.0.0/0 	>internetgateway
			>igw- 06g -- our isp or wifi router

step1:- search vpc service on search bar

-click on your vpc
-click on create vpc
-cllick on vpc only
-select (IPV4 CIDR manual input) ---> because i am using ipv4 ip address 
-ipv4 cidr (Example :- 10.0.0.0/16) 
-Tenancy :- you can select default or dedicated, in simple word default means hardware resource are share from network, and dedicated means no hardware share  
-click on create vpc

step 2 :-create subnet,but what is subnetting ? ----> in simple word subnetting is a process of provide specific range  of ip address to network for example my network id is 10.0.0.0/16 it means i can asssign ip address to 65,000 users but in my office i want only 8 ip address so i am use this subnet 10.0.0.0/29 

 click on subnets
-vpc ID (select your vpc)
-subnet name :- type any name (Example:- subnet1)
-avialability zone :- Example us-east-2a
-ipv4 cidr block :- 10.0.0.0/24 

Step 3:- Internet Gateway (it means we are purchess router for access internet)
-cleak on internet gateway
-name :- my router
-create a internet gateway
-click on attach to a vpc 
-select your vpc and click on attach

step 3 :- in this step add entry in route table,without this step user can't access internet because in this step create connectivity between isp router and own router.

-select your routing table 
-click on routes--> edit router ---> 0.0.0.0 ---> select internet gateway --> save
